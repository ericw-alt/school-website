        <h2>What is this website?</h2>
        <p>
          In short, this website is my (temporary) personal website.
          I hope I will be able to update this website frequently, and will be making some experiments and projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started this website back in 2013 to show my friends my programming skills. I never got much time to update it though.
          It is now in 2015 that I bring back this project, and you will see lots of updates very soon.
          It was hosted on Google Drive. The URLs were hard to memorize so I found an alternative.
          I finally settled upon <a href="//www.000webhost.com/">000webhost.com</a>.
          It was great and I will keep using it for a long time.
          If you also want to host a website, then you can use this fantastic service.
          Although it has a random subdomain after your link (<b>.site50.net</b> in my case), you'll have to live with that.
          After all, perfection isn't free, isn't it?

        <p>
          My name is Eric Wan. I will sometimes program and design stuff for fun.
          I don't have much yet, but stay tuned for more stuff coming soon!
          Programming is really fun, and if you haven't started learning any programming languages yet, you should.
          For complete newbies, head over to <a href="//www.codecademy.com/">codecademy.com</a>, sign up and start learning HTML!
          I currently know how to use the following programming languages:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML (obviously)</li>
            <li>CSS (how else could this page have been styled?)</li>
            <li>JavaScript (in a while I'll be developing a few small projects)</li>
            <li>PHP (I actually have a <b>.php</b> extension used for this file)</li>
            <li>Windows Batch Script (does this count?)</li>
            <li>Java (though I suck at it)</li>
            <li>***I might tackle jQuery sometime. (don't know this one yet.)***</li>
          </ul>
