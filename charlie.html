        <h2>Charlie</h2>
        <p>
          In this novel, the main character, Charlie Gordon is presented as a 32-year-old man suffering from an intellectual disability.
          As a result, his IQ is only 68, and he can't do many things, such as reading and writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the start, he attends a class for retarded adults at the Beekman Adult Center, and tries to learn to read and write.
          He doesn't get very much success, but is liked by his teacher, Ms. Kinnian.
          This just goes to show that even people with intellectual disabilities can should be treated as human.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a while, Charlie goes and gets an operation done to make him smarter.
