        <h2>Emotions</h2>
        <p>
          In the novel, the author, Daniel Keyes, shows that people with intellectual disabilities have feelings and that other people can show affection for them.
          At the start of the book, Charlie attends a class for retarded adults at the Beekman Adult Center, and tries to learn how to read and write.
          He doesn't get very much success, but is liked by his teacher, Ms. Kinnian. After a while, Charlie goes and gets an operation done to make him smarter.
          He then figures out that the scientists that did the operation, Prof. Nemur and Dr. Strauss, didn’t treat him like a human being before the operation.
          This makes Charlie very mad. Afterwards, he goes on a few dates with his teacher, who he now calls Alice.
          This was one of the parts where Charlie’s emotions were coming through the most.
